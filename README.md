They call me by many names, for you is @Lepakko-dev (or just Lepakko)

*Time will tell if the projects i work on<br>
will see the lights of day.<br>
And if I prove my dearest childs can live on,<br>
your own wishes may not be far away.*

Advocate of the Open Source.<br>
*Freedom for knowledge, knowledge for free will, and free will for Freedom*

Pronouns: Whatever tf you want.
I, Lepakko, am an internet entity, not meant to be linked with the person behind, not meant to care about pronouns.
I am not a facade, but a whole new being.
